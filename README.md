### **AWS Certified Data Engineer | Problem Solver | Python & PySpark Specialist**

I am an AWS-certified professional with 4+ years of experience at **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, where I architect and optimize large-scale data solutions for leading US asset management firms. 

My philosophy is simple: **Solve the problem first, choose the tech second.** I don’t just write code; I build impactful, cost-efficient solutions. Whether it's migrating complex legacy systems to serverless architectures or resolving critical S3 throughput bottlenecks, I focus on delivering measurable business value.
